  <div>Waiting for confirmation</div>
  <div>
    Are you an owner?<br>
    Once a biker books your garage you will, a new card will appear in your dashboard.<br>
    As an owner you have several options:
    1 - accept a request;<br>
    2 - reject a request;<br>
    3 - contact the biker;<br>
    4 - hide a request;<br>
    Once you accept a request the booking will only start once the biker enter his payment information(if he didn't already).<br>
    You can reject a request at any time before the biker enter his payment info. <br>
    You can contact the biker at any time during the rent. <br>
    You hide a request once it is "done" (the rent agreement is finished), "rejected" or "cancelled".
